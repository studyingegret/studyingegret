My OpenPGP public key
---------------------
If for any reason you'd like to send a message exclusively to me, use [my OpenPGP public key](https://github.com/studyingegret/.github/blob/main/studyingegret_public_key.asc) (fingerprint: `616B 6582 EBBD 9033 1485 8A74 ABD2 0217 5534 598E`). This requires software like GnuPG (and basic knowledge of public key encryption to feel safe about it). The encrypted message can be sent publicly or privately (at your choice), and the message cannot be decoded by anyone except me with my private key.

FAQ

### Why do you have different account names?
For legacy reasons, and also for the possibility that they'll protect me from being completely doxxed.

### I see a user called studyingegret/bettertree etc somewhere. Is it you?
All of my accounts that I'm willing to reveal relationship to are listed above.

### I'll use your public key to decrypt a message from you
I don't know why I'm writing this, but that's not how public key encryption works. The recipient gives their public key to the sender*, the sender uses it to encrypt their message, and the recipient decrypts it with their private key. So if you want to recieve an encrypted message from me, you should send me your public key and its fingerprint* so that I can encrypt for you.

\* You should also send the fingerprint of the public key, to prove that the public key is not intercepted by someone else, in which case a) you'll be unable to decode the message and b) the attacker will be able to decrypt it with its private key. I see this being neglected quite a lot
